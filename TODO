* add perl and perl-xml-parser as build-tools (needed by intltool)

* create build-tools/openimageio to make ooiotool available which
  is needed by libs/opencolorio for complete Python docstrings

* implement "provides:" property support

* check warnings for attachment header:
  - libs/wayland

* add a way for packages to be restricted to a set of architectures
  - libs/embree (x86-only)

* implement "patches:" property support
  - the goal is to allow specifying patches in the package file in order
    to automatically apply them without having to modify the Makefile
