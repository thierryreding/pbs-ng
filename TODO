* isolate builds into a sysroot that is created from scratch every time
  - this has the big benefit that it will allow reproducible builds where
    the build of a package is not impacted by the state of the global sysroot,
    which could cause additional dependencies to be pulled in
  - this is also used by most distributions to make sure no extra dependencies
    get pulled in accidentally, and it helps by making sure all the
    dependencies are properly documented

* add perl and perl-xml-parser as build-tools (needed by intltool)

* create build-tools/openimageio to make ooiotool available which
  is needed by libs/opencolorio for complete Python docstrings

* implement "provides:" property support

* check warnings for attachment header:
  - libs/wayland

* add a way for packages to be restricted to a set of architectures
  - libs/embree (x86-only)

* implement "patches:" property support
  - the goal is to allow specifying patches in the package file in order
    to automatically apply them without having to modify the Makefile
